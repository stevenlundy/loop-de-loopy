This program is inspired by [Dan Myers](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/about/) challenge to [create a great Loop De Loop](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2015/our-fall-contest-this-is-not-a-math-book/) with a math class.

The activity comes from Anna Weltmanâ€™s new math book, [This is not a Math Book](http://new.myubam.com/p/5003/this-is-not-a-math-book).
